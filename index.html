            <h4>Corporate Social Responsibility and Financial Performance: A Focus on Ownership Concentration. (Undergraduate Dissertation in progress)</h4>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify">This paper aims to study the influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) participation on financial performance, and focuses on the moderating role of ownership concentration in this relationship. The sample is composed of non-ST, non-financial companies in China's A-share market, covering the period from 2014 to 2018. The empirical results of instrumental variable (IV) method show that both CSR participation and ownership concentration have significantly positive effects on financial performance. Even when endogeneity is controlled for, this relationship will be negatively moderated by ownership concentration. In addition, in terms of the ownership of enterprises, the moderating effect is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises. Based on the analysis, I suggest that enterprises in emerging markets, especially developing countries, should adjust their ownership structure appropriately in order to maximize the positive effect of CSR participation on corporate performance.</p>

            <h4>Estimation of Large Dimensional Covariance Matrices: Empirical Analysis Based on A-share Market, May 2019</h4>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify">This paper studies 440 non-ST A-shares from 10 industries between 2009 and 2019 to test the applicability of two kinds of covariance matrix estimation methods in Chinese market. We mainly study estimation of covariance matrices in the large dimensional case where the sample dimension is larger than the sample size. The Kronecker product model factorizes and fetches the logarithm of the large-dimensional matrix, and introduces the Minimum Distance (MD) estimator and the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). The shrinkage estimation is ultimately aimed to minimize the loss function, and introduces the linear shrinkage estimator and the direct nonlinear shrinkage estimator. The empirical results show that the two kinds of estimation methods are superior to the traditional sample covariance matrix estimation, and have strong applicability in the Chinese A-share market. Each of the two methods has its own advantages: the effect of the shrinkage estimator is stable in the change of data pattern and arrangement while the Kronecker product model provides a new idea for the estimation of the parameter matrix in the dynamic model.</p>

            <h4>Unicorn Fund Return and Influencing Factors Analysis</i>, with Qianying Zhang, May 2019.<h4>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Along with the continuous evolution of the trade war, the game between Chinese and American high-tech industries has put forward new demands for accelerating institutional changes in the capital market. As a major institutional breakthrough in China's A-share market, the emergence of China Depositary Receipt (CDR) may help a large number of overseas innovation companies return to A-shares. The Unicorn Fund participates in the strategic placement of multiple memory vouchers, which are widely favored by investors for its profitability, inclusiveness and security. However, with the acceleration of the recent shareholding, the volatility of the net value of the six funds has caused the market to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. This paper aims to establish an ARIMA model of each fund's rate of return through empirical research, and analyze and evaluate the risk and performance of the unicorn fund by means of the VaR risk value model and the risk-adjusted income model based on performance indicators. Correlation between return on the securities market will be studied to obtain various factors that affect the fluctuation of its earnings.</p>

            <h4>Media Supervision and CSR Information Disclosure in the Context of New Media: An Analysis of Metal and Non-metal Manufacturing Industry</i>, with Keyi Xia, May 2018.
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify">This paper samples 130 major enterprises of metal and nonmetal manufacturing industry from 2009 to 2016. We use fixed-effect Tobit model to study the effect of media supervision on corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure and explore the influencing mechanism. We also use quantile regression test the heterogeneity of the effect that media supervision exerts. The results show that media supervision and CSR information disclosure level are positively correlated, and the higher the level of CSR information disclosure, the more obvious the effect of media supervision. We suggest that the effectiveness of media supervision requires the internal governance of enterprises, the guidance and support of the government and the further improvement of the media industry, so as to promote the transparency of CSR information and urge enterprises to take more social responsibility.</p>
